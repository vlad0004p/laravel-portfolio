                <p>I want to progress into the IT world and develop my skills. I’m looking forward to seeing firsthand what my
                    parents have glorified and why they recommended this environment. They have never lied to me and my
                    expectations are very high. I understand that the IT world is not forgiving and I need to work hard to keep
                    up.
                    <br>I have always enjoyed logical thinking and problem-solving which is why I chose this future for myself in
                    the first place. Growing up in my family I saw that this kind
                    of job can support it financially and teach the new generation of a great work ethic and time management.
                    <br>I tend to feel the happiest when I ‘know my way around’ but also have something new to learn every day. I
                    hope my future career meets both these conditions by learning the basics now and developing in the future.
