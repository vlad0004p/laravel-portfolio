                <p>I'm persistent and patient with everything I do. These have played a huge part in my progression so far in
                    life. Combined with time management and organization skills, I have always managed to keep up.</p>

                <h3>Weaknesses</h3><br>
                <p>Iâ€™m not the best orator. The stress of presenting sometimes overwhelms me I end up handling the situation in
                    not the best way. I sometimes get anxious and start stuttering which brings my confidence down.</p>

                <h3>Opportunities</h3><br>
                <p>Embracing every opportunity that comes my way, even if it involves the possibility of failure, is a valuable
                    approach to my personal growth. By taking chances and learning from both successes and setbacks, I continue to
                    develop and expand my skills and knowledge.</p>

                    weaknesses every day and improving in every aspect of life.</p>
