            <h1>First Feedback</h1>
            <p>My initial two weeks in the HBO-ICT program have been an exciting journey. I've discovered that
                successful learning in a dynamic setting involves a blend of classroom instruction and self-study.
                Collaborating with fellow students has fostered a motivating environment where we all share a passion
                for technology and strive for excellence.</p>
            <p>This collective enthusiasm encourages us to push our limits and engage in constructive feedback,
                essential for growth. We benefit from both positive reinforcement and guidance from dedicated student
                assistants and knowledgeable teachers, enhancing our programming skills.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, my early experience in the HBO-ICT program has been filled with determination and valuable
                feedback. Our shared passion for technology, combined with the support of our peers and instructors,
                promises significant progress and achievement. I look forward to what lies ahead!</p>
