            <h1>My Study Choice</h1>
            <p>I want to progress into the IT world and develop my skills. I’m looking forward to seeing firsthand what
                my parents have glorified and why they recommended this environment. They have never lied to me and my
                expectations are very high. I understand that the IT world is not forgiving and I need to work hard to
                keep up.
                I have always enjoyed logical thinking and problem-solving which is why I chose this future for myself
                in the first place. ICT opens so many career opportunities, even though I have not chosen anything
                specific yet.
                ICT can not only change my life but also the ones around me. Growing up in my family I saw that this
                kind of job can support it financially and teach the new generation of a great work ethic and time
                management.
                I tend to feel the happiest when I ‘know my way around’ but also have something new to learn every day.
                I hope my future career meets both these conditions by learning the basics now and developing in the
                future.

            <h2>My Motivation</h2>
            <p>Thinking about my future I hope to achieve a career that is fulfilling and suits my lifestyle. With my
                growing love for ICT, I have come to realize that IT IS POSSIBLE.
                I have always been able to keep track of everything I start doing and eventually finish it. When I’m not
                motivated, my biggest weapon comes to play that part – DISCIPLINE. It is human that I’m not always
                motivated
                (even though that is not the case now) but I always get the job done on time.
                Meanwhile, it is crucial for me to have someone to talk to when things don’t go as planned. My biggest
                supporters my whole life have been my family. They have held me accountable and managed to re-motivate
                me
                when I don’t feel the best. They are my biggest inspiration and the single, most important part of my
                life.
                And last but not least, im going to mention the other thing that is going to make me progress – myself.
                My
                dream is to success in life and to make that happen I need to push myself to the limit. I’m determined
                to
                keep growing in ICT and in life.
